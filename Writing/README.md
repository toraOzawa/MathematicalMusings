# Colloboration in Mathematics 
I recently started asking myself if I really believe that the way we practice and learn mathematics is ideal. This is speaking at every level: in terms of the disclipline and culture as a collective whole, a few specific subfields, as students, small research groups, etc. Being still in undegrad, my perspective is perhaps limited and naive, but I still think its important to provide so I've decided to give some account of it. Below is continually working draft.

### [Towards Some More Collaborative Mathematics](Towards_Some_More_Collaborative_Mathematics.pdf)
Started off as a smaller document. It kind of hit me when I realized some graduate students don't know how to use github. And then my train of thought kind of went wild from there and then I tried to get it on the page. I want to get my thoughts across to as general of an audience as possible, but perhaps that warrants separate versions. Narrowing down the audience would make it a lot easier about alluding to details. Also probably deserves a clean rewrite from scrtach at some point. 

A version I submitted for a job application at Quanta Magazine is in the directory below. The title is much more pretentious in this first version. 

### [Quanta Samples](QuantaSamples)
Some writing samples I submitted for a job application at Quanta Magazine. 

So far this will consist of some stuff I wrote for classes and for myself, among other things.
