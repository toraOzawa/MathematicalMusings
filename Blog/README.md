# Some "Simple" Algebraic Manipulations
A current professor of one of my classes said the following: "I am still amazed at how many subtle and/or nontrival things are hidden in simple algebraic constructions".

Here's a few I've encoutered recently which I thought were neat.



### An associative algebra is a Lie Algebra via [X, Y] = XY - YX
Yes this is a trivial computation, and billinearity is obvious for both directions when done in one. But there is a slighlty more efficient and conceptual way of doing it after doing it in one coordinate.
