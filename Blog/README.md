# Some "Simple" Algebraic Manipulations
A current professor of one of my classes said the following: "I am still amazed at how many subtle and/or nontrival things are hidden in simple algebraic constructions".

Here's a few I've encoutered recently which I thought were neat. They all are good examples of why we should always precisely explain why things are obvious. Each is less trivial than the next. Although the last may be an example of what one of my professors would call "using nuclear weapons for elementary problems". 



### An associative algebra is a Lie Algebra via [X, Y] = XY - YX
Yes this is a trivial computation, and billinearity is obvious for both directions when done in one. But there is a slighlty more efficient and conceptual way of doing it after doing it in one coordinate.

### ["A non-visual proof that higher homotopy groups are abelian"](https://stanford.edu/~sfh/homotopy.pdf)
The visual proof is neat, and I believe this is essentially just the formalization of it. 

### The parallelogram inequality as an instance of the [Von Neumman-Fr√©chet theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%27s_theorem)
