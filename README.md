# MathematicalMusings
A site to catalog my interests, academic pursuits, and so on. May turn this into a bonafide website eventually.

# About Me
I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Rochester studying Math and Computer Science. I am currently fixated on Algebraic Geometric things. I've always had a soft spot for areas which tie in lots of areas and builds on subjects I like. Generally this includes some algbra, some logic, some category theory, and some geometry. 

Currently focusing on learning the foundations of algebraic geometry. I am using a two pronged approach: I a, using Harris's *Algebraic Geometry* and the beginnings of Hartshorne in a course at Math in Moscow (online), while learning with the more modern scheme theoretic approach through (Vakil's *the Rising Sea*). 

I am also drawn to the various Bourbakian approaches of reformulating and solving problems in combinatorics, number theory, and computer science. This has made me curious about things like geometric complexity theory, tropical geometry, and geometric langlands.

# [UR AG Reading Group](https://github.com/toraOzawa/URAGReadingGroup/)
An algebraic geometry reading group I am organizing. It is run by advanced undergraduates and graduate students: we meet once a week and a student will take the lead to present some material, largely following Vakil's *The Rising Sea*. We bring questions and look at important exercises as well. Our group has various backgrounds and we try to give lots of perspective during the talks. 

# Projects
Here are some ongoing fledgling projects of mine. Mostly still in the setup stage.

Some non technical writing of mine related to mathematics.
