# MathematicalMusings
A site to catalog my interests, academic pursuits, and so on. May turn this into a bonafide website eventually.

# About Me
I am a senior undergraduate at the University of Rochester studying Math and Computer Science. I am currently fixated on Algebraic Geometric things. I've always had a soft spot for areas which tie in lots of areas and builds on subjects I like. Generally this includes some algbra, some logic, some category theory, and some geometry. I am also drawn to the various Bourbakian approaches of solving problems in combinatorics, number theory, and computer science. 

# Organization
Generally will have some files on here, and will also try to provide links to them through here. Will likely create multiple repos to serve as different pages.
